Important Classes
=================

+ AproximativeSearchImpl.AddressService
  It is a thread safe implementation of the IAddressService. It uses the class StreetRepositoryLucene for inserting and searching for documents
in the lucene index.
  The result of the Search method is a list of street names prioritized by hit. The street name can contain several tokens that will be used for 
searching the streets aproximtively. 

+ StreetFinder.StreetRepositoryLucene
  It is a lucene wrapper that allows for indexing street documents and offers a method for searching for streets aproximatively.
It uses the StreetAnalyzer for analyzing the street name for indexing. The street analyzer produces tokens that will be stored used for indexing and searching streets. 

+ StreetFinder.StreetAnalyzer
  It is the implementation of a Lucene analyzer that it used for analyzing street documents. It generates the tokens for the reverted index
that are later indexed by the StreetRepository. The generated tokens are Edge-Ngram, abbreviations tokens and combined tokens.

+ StreetFinder.CombineFilter.CombineTokenFilter
  It is a Lucene filter that combines tokens. Combined tokens are necessary when searching for street names without spaces between them.
  E.g. The tokens "Erika" "Mann" will be combined in "Erikamann" and "Mann". It takes into account that abbreviations at the beginning of a street name cannot be combined. 

+ StreetFinder.AbbreviationsFilter.AbbreviationTokenFilter
  It is a Lucene filter that uses an abbreviation engine to add abbreviations or introduce the text that was abbreviated to the list of tokens that will be indexed.
  The tokens that are generated by this filter facilitates searching for abbreviations or the abbreviated words.
  E.g. the abbreviation "str" will be expanded into "Strasse" and "Straﬂe". The word "Sankt" will be abbreviated into "st".
